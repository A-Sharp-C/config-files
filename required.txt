i3 with dmenu
	programs needed:
		feh - background
		urxvt - terminal
		dmenu - dynamic menu (alt+d), should come pre-installed with i3

	relies on:
		.Xresources
		set feh background in ~/.i3/config (near bottom of file)

openbox
	programs needed:
		feh - background
		urxvt - terminal
		tint2 - task bar
		dmenu - dynamic menu
		amixer - for volume controls

	relies on:
		.Xresources
		tint2rc
		set feh backround in ~/.config/openbox/autostart


To be able to use this as intended the following programs are needed

openbox
i3
tint2
dmenu
urxvt
feh
amixer - i think also alsamixer would be good to have
