# config-files
This is a collection of my config files.
It is packaged relatively to where the files should be placed on the system.
This repo is mainly for me, so I can easily set up my own systems with i3 and openbox configs.
However, feel free to use this repo however you'd like.

### ~/
* .Xresources

### ~/.config/openbox/
* autostart
* menu.xml
* rc.xml

### ~/.config/tint2/
* tint2rc
* tintwizard.conf
* tintwizard.py

## ~/.i3/
* config

Some openbox themes are also included and are used in the openbox configuration.
If you choose to not use the included themes, you will need to change it in obconf.
