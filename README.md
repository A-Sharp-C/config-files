# config-files
This is a collection of my config files.
It is packaged relatively to where the files should be placed on the system.
This repo is mainly for me, so I can easily set up my own systems with i3 and openbox configs.
However, feel free to use this repo however you'd like.

### ~/
* .vimrc
* .Xresources

### ~/.config/openbox/
* autostart
* menu.xml
* rc.xml

### ~/.config/tint2/
* tint2rc
* tintwizard.conf
* tintwizard.py

## ~/.i3/
* config
